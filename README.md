The Hotel Management System is a Python-based project integrated with MySQL for database management. It is designed to streamline the operations of a hotel by allowing an organization to manage hotel details, room availability, employee bookings, and payment methods efficiently.

Key Features:
Hotel and Room Management:

The system stores and updates details about the hotel, including its name, address, and contact information.
Room details such as room numbers, types (single, double, suite), availability status, and pricing are recorded and managed.
Employee Room Booking:

Employees can book rooms based on their preferences, with the system checking availability.
The system updates room availability after each booking.
Payment Management:

Various payment methods (e.g., cash, credit card, online payment) are recorded.
Payment details for each booking are stored for future reference.
Database Integration:

All data (hotel details, rooms, bookings, employees, payments) is stored in a MySQL database.
Python interacts with MySQL using libraries like mysql-connector-python to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Real-Time Updates:

The system ensures real-time updates to room availability and payment records to avoid double bookings and inconsistencies.
